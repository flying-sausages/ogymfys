# ogymfys
ogymfys stands for "ogymfys gets your music from your server"

## Introduction
This script is made for those who accumulate new music on their server, retrieve said music from their remote server, make a copy/transcode for their personal use (or not) and then store the original files as a backup (or not)

As I develop this further, I'll add more options for what this tool can do for you, however the idea will always be that this should help you sync down new music from your remote, NIX based box.
